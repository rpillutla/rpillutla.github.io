  <h1> Yoga or Yoga Therapy? Does it matter? </h1>

  <p>
    The question I am asked most often is what the difference between yoga and
    yoga therapy is. What is the right choice for you? Let's take a quick look.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yoga is an ancient system of mind-body practices aimed at reducing suffering.
    Practically, that translates into asana, pranayama, mudras, meditation. A yoga
    student then, is one that wants to gain knowledge and experience in such practices.

      <b>
          A regular yoga class focuses on learning
          yoga itself, the techniques and practices.
      </b>
    </p>
  </center>

  <p>
    While yoga in itself is healing because of its focus on the individual and
    the emphasis on the connection between the mind and the body, yoga therapy
    sessions go a step further.
  </p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.2em;padding-left:3%; padding-right:3%">
      <b>
        A therapeutic yoga session focuses on applying a subset of those practices
        to address the health needs of the individual.
      </b>
    </p>
  </center>

  <p>
    The yoga therapy client, therefore, usually comes seeking help for some symptom
    or health condition. Common examples are pain management, stress, sleeplessness,
    metabolic issues, and mental health disorders. The goal is to reach a state of
    optimal mental, physical, and emotional well-being.

        What that means for you and me is that we work together to understand
        what you need and what you want in terms of health and fitness, and find
        a realistic plan to achieve that through yoga or yoga therapy.
