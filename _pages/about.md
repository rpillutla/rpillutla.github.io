Hi!

I am Ramya, and I am a yoga therapist and teacher. I believe in the value of healing through yoga and am working to bring it into mainstream medicine and healthcare as an adjunct treatment, and into the lives of all people, healthy or not, as a way of finding our inherent wellness and wholeness.

I am certified by the International Association of Yoga Therapists ([IAYT](https://www.iayt.org/page/certification)) as a C-IAYT yoga therapist and by the Yoga Alliance as an RYT-500 Advanced Teacher. I have specialised training in yoga therapy from the Kripalu School of Yoga in Massachusetts, USA and am also a certified yoga instructor from SVYASA University, Bangalore, India. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Yoga from SVYASA.

When I'm not out teaching, trekking, or traveling, I spend my time on music, art, books, and reading about the brain.
