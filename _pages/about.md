Hi!

I am Ramya, and I am a therapeutic yoga teacher. I believe in the value of healing through yoga and am working to bring it into mainstream medicine and healthcare as an adjunct treatment, and into the lives of all people, healthy or not, as a way of finding our inherent wellness and wholeness.

When I'm not out teaching, trekking, or traveling, I spend my time on music, art, books, and reading about the brain.
