Hi!

Test test test

I am Ramya, and I am a therapeutic yoga teacher. I believe in the value of healing through yoga and am working to bring it into mainstream medicine and healthcare as an adjunct treatment, and into the lives of all people, healthy or not, as a way of finding our inherent wellness and wholeness.

Beyond an international Yoga Alliance teaching certification, I have specialised training in yoga therapy from the Kripalu School of Yoga in Massechusetts, USA and am certified as an RYT500 Advanced Teacher of Therapeutic Yoga. I am also currently pursuing my Masters in Yoga from SVYASA in Bangalore, India.

When I'm not out teaching, trekking, or traveling, I spend my time on music, art, books, and reading about the brain.
