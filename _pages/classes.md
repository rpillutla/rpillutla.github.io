My group schedule will be up soon here. Drop me a [message](/contact/) if you would like to receive email notifications with schedule updates.</p>

Yoga, these days, is a broad term encompassing a whole variety of classes involving asanas, pranayama, yoga nidra, meditation, kriyas, and yogic philosophy. This might leave you confused about what type of classes you would like. Here I've elaborated on classes that I take. If you are looking for any of them, do drop me a message to discuss scheduling. I take group, private, corporate, and public classes. If the type of class you are looking for is not present in this list, let me know what it is you are looking for so I can help you find it.

## Traditional Hatha Yoga

</figure>My hatha classes are largely focused on breath-centred asanas, whether it be a flow of asanas or lots of static holding. While the emphasis is on asanas, these classes also include a bit of pranayama and meditation.

Sometimes, a class might have a specific focus like leg-strengthening, or improving flexibility.

## Core Hatha
These are a specific subset of hatha classes that I've found both highly beneficial and frequently requested. Core-focused classes involve asanas and pranayama meant to strengthen and improve awareness of the core, which includes the abdominal muscles, the back, glutes, deep core muscles, and in an extended sense, the thighs. A strong core is a great addition to a healthy body and spine.

## Asana, Pranayama, Meditation (APM)
APM classes involve significant amounts of all three: asanas, pranayama, and meditation, with mudras and bandhas as appropriate. They tend to be physically less demanding than intense hatha sessions and are ideal for developing breath awareness, focus, and relaxation. A must-try for anyone who wants to do yoga.

## Asana with Props (in the style of Iyengar)

</figure>This is usually a studio-only class, unless you have props (blocks, bolsters, and/or yoga belts) with you at home. I love using makeshift props too though, those that are found around the house. Chairs, walls, water bottles, you name it. In general, though, if you are specifically looking for a class that uses props to either work on alignment or strength or awareness, I would advise you go to a studio. 

Props support parts of your body so that the asana experience can be deeper, and you can achieve the benefits of an asana otherwise not reachable normally without pushing your body too far beyond its normal range of movement. Apart from structural integrity and precision, blocks, bolsters, chairs, straps and blankets are used extensively to allow for long holds in a posture.

Other yoga styles where props play a central role are restorative and Yin yoga. Here, props form effective tool to facilitate relaxation and wellbeing in the yogiâ€™s practice.

I have an article I wrote about doing yoga with props [here](http://www.merkabah.yoga/to-prop-or-not-to-prop/).

## Meditation:
Meditation classes are shorter sessions of only guided meditation. I would recommend this for intermediate or advanced practitioners or those with previous meditation practice. If you're a beginner, it would be best to start with a couple of hatha or APM classes.
