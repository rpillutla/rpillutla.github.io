Would you like a long vacation and a clear blue ocean to feel calm? Me too.

Calmness and stability are essential components to a healthy and fulfilling life. Finding peace in chaos is certainly not easy, but you've already taken the first step. Take a moment to notice your breath. Is it deep or shallow? Slow or fast?

Is there any tightness in your chest as you breathe?

Your breath is a fairly accessible indicator of your state of mind. Anxiety and stress are often accompanied by shallow or irregular breathing. How about when you change that? How about when you breathe deeply and regularly?

### Pranayama and Meditation

Pranayama and meditation are two terms that are often confused for each other.
Pranayama is the regulation of breath and prana, your vital life-force energy.
The yoga tradition has several such practices, some of which we will be
exploring here. Meditation is a broad term that is about developing awareness
and a sense of perspective in any given situation. What falls under meditation
is vague and vast but common techniques used include watching the breath,
focusing on a specific object, open mindfulness. An important distinction
between pranayama and meditation that is centred around the breath is that
pranayama is about regulation and even modification sometimes, while meditation
emphasises watching what already is without judging or seeking to change it.
