Depression and anxiety are two increasingly prevalent mood disorders. Depression involves persistent sadness and a loss of interest or pleasure in activities that are usually enjoyable. Anxiety is characterised by symptoms of fear, worry or panic, and difficulty in getting adequate sleep.

People experience depression and anxiety in different ways that disturb daily functioning and cause distress. It can be a vague sense of unease and sadness that just doesnâ€™t go away. It can be persistent sadness without a clear cause. Anxiety can come with a lack of desire to eat or with excessive eating to reduce stress. You might even be having a hard time falling asleep at night because your mind is racing.

Both depression and anxiety often lead to excessive thinking about upsetting situations, resulting in worrying about causes, consequences, and what might have been. This excessive thinking, in turn, worsens anxiety and depression, creating a self-fulfilling vicious cycle.

Yoga is a mind-body intervention that has been around since ancient times. It involves physical postures and movement (asanas), breath work (pranayama), and meditation in addition to guidelines that help cultivate a more tranquil state of mind. Studies have shown that it can reduce excessive and unproductive thinking, improve sleep, increase energy levels, and promote positive states of mind. Additionally, yoga greatly reduces stress.

Mental health has been consistently shown to improve with physical activity and exercise. The added advantage of yoga postures (asanas) is that they teach you to be in the present moment and develop an awareness of the state of your body and mind.

Pranayama, or specific breath work, works with your energy levels. Some types of pranayama are beneficial to improve energy levels and overcome fatigue. Some are great to calm agitation and restlessness. And some, like alternate nostril breathing, are extremely balancing in nature.

A consistent pranayama and asana practice also helps counter common side effects of medication: weight gain, lethargy, and trouble focusing.

To round it off, meditation teaches you to bring your attention to the present moment. It helps you focus better, stay calm, observe your emotions, and sleep well through the development of mindfulness and awareness.

Yoga, under the guidance and supervision of a trained professional, can teach you to lead a happier and healthier life.
