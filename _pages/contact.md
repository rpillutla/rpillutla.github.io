You can <a href="mailto:healwithramya@gmail.com">email</a> me or message me on <a href="https://instagram.com/ramyapillutla">instagram</a>.

Or, drop me a message on this form below to quickly get in touch!

<form method="post">
<label>Your Email ID</label>
<input name="email" type="email" placeholder="So that I can respond to you." required>

<label>Your message:</label>
<textarea rows="5" placeholder="I want to hear what you have to say." required></textarea>

<button class="btn btn--large" type="submit">Send</button>

(I'll add this part after I get your form, there's some shady stuff I need to
do to embed it that'll depend on the field ids and the form id of the form Google creates)
